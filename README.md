## TASK 4 - localStorage
    
Save the response of the fetch in a key calls ***users*** in the localStorage.
## TASK 5 - state-init-value
    
Create a state called ***users*** which has as its initial value the value of the ***key users in the localstorage***.

## TASK 6 - update fetch

Update the fetch code, because you only want to fetch if the ***users state*** is not empty.

Create a state called ***users*** which has as its initial value the value of the ***key users in the localstorage***.

## TASK 8 - show-users

You need an input for the name, username and email and password (you don't need to show the password in the UI).

## TASK 11 - password-toggle
    
Add an icon in the input-password that gives you the possibility to hide the password, if the password is hidden then show another icon that gives you the possibility to show the password (then you will only be able to see one icon).

Use the [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) as icons.

## TASK 12 - hover-border

Change the border colour of the containers showing each user in the UI when hovering with the mouse.
